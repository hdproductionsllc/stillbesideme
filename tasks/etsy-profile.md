## SHOP SETUP

### Shop Name
`StillBesideMeCo`

> Etsy doesn't allow spaces. "StillBesideMe" may be taken – have backups:
> `StillBesideMeShop`, `StillBesideMeArt`, `StillBesideMePrints`

### Shop Title (55 characters max – appears under your shop name in search)
```
Personalized Memorial Wall Art | Custom Poem Tributes
```
(54 characters)

### Shop Announcement (appears at top of your shop page)
```
Welcome to Still Beside Me – where your memories become wall art that stays.

You share a photo and a few memories. We write a poem that's truly about them – not generic, not from a template. Every word comes from what you tell us. Then we print it on archival paper, frame it in real wood, and ship it to your door.

What you get:
→ A custom poem or letter written from YOUR memories
→ Their photo professionally enhanced
→ Museum-quality archival paper (100+ year rating)
→ Real wood frame, ready to hang
→ Full design proof before we print – change any word

We started this after losing a cat named Littles. We wanted something for the wall that actually captured her – the weird little voice, the way she'd sit on the laptop, the nicknames only we used. Nothing like that existed, so we made it.

Now we do it for pets and people.

Most orders ship within 5-7 business days. Every piece is made to order.

Questions? Message us anytime – we're real people and we respond fast.

## ABOUT SECTION

### Shop Story
```
Still Beside Me started with a cat named Littles.

When we lost her, we looked for something to put on the wall – something that actually captured who she was. Not a generic "Rainbow Bridge" poem. Not a paw print kit. Something that mentioned her weird little chirping voice, the way she'd drape herself across the laptop at the worst possible moment, and the nickname we used when nobody was listening.

Nothing like that existed. So we built it.

We created a way to take your photos and your memories and turn them into a personalized poem tribute – printed on museum-quality paper, framed in real wood, and designed to stay on the wall for years.

The poem isn't pulled from a library (though we have those too, if you prefer). It's written specifically from what you share with us. Your pet's name, their quirks, the favorite toy, that one memory you keep coming back to. All of it goes into a poem that could only be about them.

After we launched pet tributes, families started asking: "Can you do this for my mom?" "What about my grandfather?"

So we created Letter From Heaven – a first-person letter written from your loved one's perspective, using the memories and details you share. It reads like they're writing home to say they're okay and they're still with you.

Every order gets a full design proof before we print. You can change any word, adjust the layout, or swap the photo. We don't print until you love it.

This isn't a side project or a dropshipping store. Every piece is designed individually, reviewed by a real person, and made with materials that last.

We believe the things you hang on your wall should mean something. And we believe the people and pets you've lost deserve more than a generic card that ends up in a drawer.

They deserve a place on the wall.

A LETTER FROM SOMEONE YOU MISS

Imagine a letter from them – written in their voice, mentioning the things only they would say. The phrases they repeated. The lessons they taught without trying. The small moments that mattered most.

That's what this is.

You share your memories. We write a first-person letter from their perspective – as if they're writing home to say they're okay, they're proud of you, and they're still with you. Then we print it alongside their photo on museum-quality paper, frame it in real wood, and ship it ready to hang.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

A MEANINGFUL SYMPATHY GIFT

This is what people send instead of flowers.

Flowers last a week. Cards end up in a drawer. This goes on the wall and stays there – on the hard mornings, the anniversaries, the regular Tuesdays when you just miss them.

Ordering for someone else? You don't need to know everything about their loved one. A name, a photo, and whatever you do know is enough. We'll create something that makes them feel seen.

Gift wrapping available. We can ship directly to the recipient.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT CUSTOMERS SAY

"Mom reads it every morning with her coffee. It's like having Dad in the room." – Chris W.

"I didn't think anything could help after losing my sister. This is the one thing I look at every day." – Maria G.

"We gave this to Grandma for Christmas. She cried. Then she hung it next to his chair." – The Reynolds Family

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FAQ

Q: What if I don't have a great photo?
A: We work with whatever you have. Old photos, phone pictures, even scanned prints are fine. We enhance everything professionally.

Q: Can I edit the letter?
A: Yes – complete control. You see the full design before we print. Change any word, request a rewrite, or use your own text.

Q: How long does it take?
A: Design proof within 24 hours. After approval, ships in 5-7 business days.

Q: Is this religious?
A: The "Letter From Heaven" concept is spiritual but non-denominational. If you'd prefer specific religious references included or excluded, just let us know. We write it to match your family's beliefs.

THE SYMPATHY GIFT THEY'LL ACTUALLY KEEP

You want to send something that matters. Not flowers that wilt. Not a card that ends up in a drawer. Something that goes on the wall and stays there.

This is a custom poem alongside their pet's photo – printed on archival paper, framed in real wood, ready to hang.

You don't need to know every detail about their pet. Here's what we can work with:

→ The pet's name and a photo (that's the minimum)
→ Anything else you know – breed, personality, a story about them
→ Even just "she was a golden retriever who loved swimming" gives us enough

We'll write a poem that feels personal and specific – not something pulled from a template. They'll read it and think, "How did they know that?"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

HOW TO ORDER AS A GIFT

1. Place your order
2. In the personalization box, share whatever you know about the pet
3. We'll write the poem and send YOU the proof first
4. You approve (or have us adjust)
5. We ship directly to your friend – gift-wrapped if you'd like

We can include a handwritten note from you. Just tell us what you'd like it to say.

```

**Description:**

A LETTER FROM MOM

She'd want you to know she's okay. She'd want to mention that thing she always said – the one you can still hear in her voice. She'd want you to know she's proud of you. And she'd want you to stop worrying.

This is that letter.

You share your memories of her – her personality, something she always said, a moment that captures who she was – and we write a first-person letter from her perspective. As if she sat down to write you one more note.

Then we print it alongside her photo on archival paper, frame it in real wood, and ship it ready to hang.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT

This isn't a generic poem with "Mom" inserted into the blanks. This is written from YOUR memories of YOUR mom. The details that made her who she was. The things only your family would know.

When you read it, it sounds like her. That's the whole point.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

HOW IT WORKS

1. Order and upload her photo
2. Tell us about her – personality, a favorite memory, something she always said
3. We write a personal letter in her voice
4. You review the full design before we print (change any word)
5. We print, frame, and ship

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT'S INCLUDED

✦ Custom letter written from your memories, in her voice

SYMPATHY GIFT

If you're ordering for someone who lost their mother, this is the gift they'll keep forever. You don't need to know everything about their mom – a name, a photo, and whatever you do know is enough.

We can ship directly to the recipient, gift-wrapped with a note from you.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

"Mom hung it next to Dad's chair. She reads it with her morning coffee. She says it sounds just like him." – Chris W.

## LISTING PHOTOS – WHAT TO CREATE

Etsy allows 10 photos per listing. Here's what to shoot/mock up:

### Photo 1 – Hero (This is what shows in search results)
- The framed piece hanging on a real wall (lifestyle shot)
- Warm lighting, clean background (cream/white wall, near a plant or lamp)
- Slightly angled to show frame depth and glass reflection
- Text should be readable at thumbnail size

### Photo 2 – Flat Lay / Detail
- The framed piece on a clean surface, shot from directly above or 45 degrees
- Shows the full design clearly – photo, poem text, layout

### Photo 3 – Close-Up of Text
- Cropped to show the poem/letter text up close
- Demonstrates print quality and typography

### Photo 4 – Close-Up of Frame Corner
- Shows the real wood grain, mat quality, glass edge
- Communicates "this is premium, not a cheap print"

### Photo 5 – All 3 Frame Styles
- Side-by-side comparison: Classic Dark, Warm Natural, Soft Light
- Helps customers choose their style

### Photo 6 – Size Comparison
- Show all 4 sizes with a reference object (sofa, person's hand, ruler)
- OR a graphic showing dimensions with measurements labeled

### Photo 7 – "How It Works" Infographic
- Simple 4-step visual:
  1. Upload photo → 2. Share memories → 3. Review proof → 4. Hang on wall
- Use your brand fonts and colors

### Photo 8 – Unboxing / Packaging
- Show the piece being pulled from packaging
- Corner protectors visible, careful wrapping
- Communicates "we care about safe delivery"

### Photo 9 – Gift Scenario
- Someone handing the framed piece to someone else
- OR: wrapped gift with a handwritten note beside it
- Communicates "this makes a perfect gift"

### Photo 10 – Multiple Room Settings
- Show the same piece in 2-3 different rooms/settings
- Living room, bedroom, hallway
- Helps customers visualize it in their space

### Tips for Etsy Photos
- First photo MUST stand out at thumbnail size – use a mockup with readable text
- Use natural light or warm studio lighting (matches your brand)
- Avoid busy backgrounds – keep it clean
- Show REAL frames if possible (not just digital mockups) – Etsy buyers value authenticity
- Consistent editing style across all photos (warm, slightly desaturated = your brand)

## ETSY SEO STRATEGY

### How Etsy Search Works
Etsy matches your **title + tags + categories + attributes** against buyer searches.
The first few words of your title carry the most weight.

### Title Formula
```
[Primary Keyword] | [Secondary Keyword] | [Product Description] | [Gift Occasion]
```

### Tag Strategy
- Use all 13 tags on every listing
- Tags should be PHRASES, not single words ("pet memorial gift" not "pet")
- Don't repeat exact phrases from your title in tags (Etsy already indexes the title)
- Include long-tail variations buyers actually search
- Mix "gift for" and "loss of" and "memorial" and "sympathy" phrasing

### High-Value Search Terms to Target
**Pet:**
- pet memorial, pet loss gift, dog memorial, cat memorial, pet sympathy gift
- personalized pet memorial, custom pet poem, pet remembrance
- loss of dog, loss of cat, pet bereavement gift

**Human:**
- loss of mother gift, loss of father gift, sympathy gift
- memorial gift, in loving memory, letter from heaven
- bereavement gift, remembrance gift, loss of loved one
- condolence gift, memorial wall art, personalized memorial

## PRICING STRATEGY FOR ETSY

### Etsy Fees (factor into your margins)
- **Listing fee:** $0.20 per listing (renews every 4 months or on sale)
- **Transaction fee:** 6.5% of sale price + shipping
- **Payment processing:** 3% + $0.25
- **Total Etsy take:** ~10-11% of each sale

### Recommended Etsy Pricing
Keep prices the same as your website. Etsy buyers expect handmade/custom goods to cost more than mass-produced, so your price point ($79.95–$159.95) is well within the memorial art range on Etsy.

If you want to incentivize website orders later (higher margins), you could eventually price Etsy 5-10% higher – but start with matching prices to build reviews and traction.

### Free Shipping Consideration
Etsy boosts listings with free shipping in search results. Consider:
- Building shipping cost into your product price
- Offering free shipping on orders $100+ (covers your 11×14 and up)
- At minimum, offer free shipping on the 16×20 and 20×24

## AUTO-REPLY MESSAGE TEMPLATE

When a customer messages you on Etsy:
```
Thanks for reaching out! We typically respond within a few hours.

If you're placing an order, here's what helps us create the best tribute:
• A photo of your loved one (any quality is fine – we enhance everything)
• Their name
• A memory or two – personality, something they said, what made them special

The more you share, the more personal the poem. But even just a name and photo is enough to get started.

We'll send you a full design proof before we print anything. 💛
```

---

## POST-PURCHASE MESSAGE TEMPLATE

Sent automatically after an Etsy sale:
```
Thank you so much for your order. We know this piece means a lot, and we're honored to create it.

To get started, we need:

1. A PHOTO – Upload it here or reply to this message with the photo attached. Any quality works – old photos, phone pictures, even screenshots. We enhance everything.

2. THEIR STORY – Share a few details so we can write a poem that's truly about them:
   • Their name

## V2 IDEAS – AFTER LAUNCH

Once you have reviews and traction, consider:

1. **Etsy Ads** – Start at $1-5/day targeting your best-performing listing
2. **More relationship-specific listings** – Loss of Grandmother, Loss of Husband, Loss of Child (high-emotion, high-search-volume)
3. **Holiday bundles** – Mother's Day, Father's Day, Christmas memorial gifts
4. **Digital download version** – Lower price point ($19.95-$29.95), instant delivery, they print themselves. Captures customers who won't wait for shipping.
5. **Smaller formats** – Ornaments, 5×7" desk frames, bookmark-sized prints
6. **Seasonal listings** – "First Christmas Without [Name]" memorial ornament/print
7. **Repeat customer coupon** – Etsy lets you create targeted coupons for past buyers
8. **Cross-sell in thank you notes** – Include a card in the shipment: "Create a tribute for another loved one – 15% off your next order"
