# WHCC API Outreach Message

Use this as a base template for reaching out to WHCC (and adapt for other print labs if needed).

---

I'm a professional photographer and existing WHCC customer. I'm building Still Beside Me (stillbesideme.com) - an e-commerce memorial tribute site where customers design personalized framed pieces (photo + custom poem/letter) through an online customizer.

The workflow: customer uploads a photo, shares memories, we generate a personalized poem, they approve a design proof, then we need to submit the print-ready file to WHCC for framed printing and white-label drop shipping directly to the customer.

I'm looking to integrate with the WHCC Order Submit API to automate this. Specifically I need:
- Programmatic order submission
- White-label drop shipping to the end customer
- Webhook or tracking number callbacks for order status updates

I already have a studio account with WHCC and have been ordering through the traditional workflow.

I'd like API access credentials so I can build the integration from my Node.js backend. Can you point me to the right team or onboarding process for API access?

Thank you!
