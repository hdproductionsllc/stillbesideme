    text: `Just this side of Heaven
is a place called Rainbow Bridge.

When a pet dies who has been
especially close to someone here,
that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge.

There are meadows and hills
for all of our special friends,
so they can run and play together.

They are happy and content,
except for one small thing —
they each miss someone very special
who was left behind.

The day comes when one suddenly
stops and looks into the distance.
Their bright eyes are intent,
their eager body begins to quiver.

Suddenly, they break from the group,
flying over the green grass,
their legs carrying them
faster and faster.

You have been spotted,
and when you and your special friend
finally meet,
you cling together in joyous reunion,
never to be parted again.`

    text: `If tears could build a stairway
and memories a lane,
I would walk right up to Heaven
and bring you home again.

No farewell words were spoken,
no time to say goodbye.
You were gone before I knew it,
and only God knows why.

My heart still aches with sadness,
and secret tears still flow.
What it meant to lose you,
no one will ever know.`

    text: `Do not stand at my grave and weep,
I am not there, I do not sleep.

I am a thousand winds that blow,
I am the diamond glints on snow.
I am the sunlight on ripened grain,
I am the gentle autumn rain.

When you awaken in the morning hush,
I am the swift uplifting rush
of quiet birds in circled flight.
I am the soft star that shines at night.

Do not stand at my grave and cry,
I am not there, I did not die.`

    text: `You were more than just a pet,
you were family.
You were more than just a friend,
you were my heart.

Your paws left prints
upon my soul
that time will never fade.

The house feels quiet now
without your gentle sounds,
but love like ours
knows no such thing as gone.

You are still beside me,
in every sunrise,
in every quiet moment,
in every beat of my heart.`

    text: `You came into my life so small
and filled it up so tall.
With every wag, with every purr,
you gave your love to all.

Now the days feel longer,
and the house feels far too wide,
but I carry you within me —
you are always by my side.

Not gone. Not forgotten.
Forever in my heart.`

    text: `I thought of you today,
but that is nothing new.
I thought about you yesterday
and days before that too.

I think of you in silence,
I often speak your name.
All I have are memories
and a picture in a frame.

Your memory is a keepsake
from which I'll never part.
God has you in His arms,
I have you in my heart.

Until we meet again.`

    text: `I am standing upon the seashore.
A ship at my side spreads her white sails
to the morning breeze
and starts for the blue ocean.

She is an object of beauty and strength.
I stand and watch her until at length
she hangs like a speck of white cloud
just where the sea and sky
come to mingle with each other.

And someone at my side says,
"There, she is gone."

Gone where?
Gone from my sight, that is all.
She is just as large in mast and hull
and spar as she was when she left my side.

And just at the moment
when someone at my side says,
"There, she is gone,"
there are other eyes watching her coming,
and other voices ready to take up the glad shout,

"Here she comes!"`

    text: `You left paw prints on my heart
that will never wash away.
The memories we made together
are with me every day.

You taught me how to love
without condition or reserve.
A loyalty so pure and true,
more than I could ever deserve.

Now when the sun sets golden
and the evening stars appear,
I know that you are watching
and I know that you are near.`

    preview: 'When tomorrow starts without me and I\'m not there to see...',
    text: `When tomorrow starts without me
and I'm not there to see,
if the sun should rise
and find your eyes
all filled with tears for me,

I wish so much
you wouldn't cry
the way you did today,
while thinking of the many things
we didn't get to say.

I know how much you love me,
as much as I love you,
and each time that you think of me,
I know you'll miss me too.

So when tomorrow starts without me,
don't think we're far apart,
for every time you think of me,
I'm right here in your heart.`
