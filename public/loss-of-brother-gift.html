          <h3>Will the letter actually sound like my brother?</h3>
          <p>We ask about his personality, how he talked, and the things he used to say. A brother who showed love through humor sounds different from one who was the quiet protector. The more you share, the more it sounds like him. And you can edit every word before we print.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Can I send this to someone who just lost their brother?</h3>
          <p>Yes. The letter is warm and grounding &ndash; it celebrates who he was, not how he died. It focuses on the sibling bond, the shared memories, and the things he'd want his family to know. Families tell us it becomes the most meaningful thing in the house.</p>

          <h3>What if I don't have many details to share?</h3>
          <p>Even a name, a photo, and one or two memories make a beautiful letter. The more you share, the more personal it gets, but we guide you through it. There's no wrong amount.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Can I edit the letter before it's printed?</h3>
          <p>Yes. You see a full design proof before anything goes to print. Edit any line, regenerate the letter, or start over. Nothing prints until you say it's right. 100% satisfaction guarantee.</p>
