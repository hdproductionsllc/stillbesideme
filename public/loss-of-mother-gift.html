          <h3>How does a Letter From Heaven for loss of a mother work?</h3>
          <p>You share memories about your mother &ndash; her personality, things she said, how she made people feel. We write a first-person letter from her perspective, as if she's speaking to the children and family she loves. You approve every word before we print.</p>

          <h3>Will the letter actually sound like my mom?</h3>
          <p>We ask about her personality, how she spoke, and the things she used to say. A mother who called everyone "sweetheart" sounds different from one who showed love through cooking or quiet acts of service. The more you share, the more it sounds like her.</p>

          <h3>Can I send this to someone who just lost their mother?</h3>
          <p>Yes. The letter is warm and comforting &ndash; it celebrates who she was, not how she died. It focuses on love, presence, and the things she'd want her family to know. Families tell us it becomes the most meaningful thing in the house.</p>

          <h3>What if I don't have many details to share?</h3>
          <p>Even a name, a photo, and one or two memories make a beautiful letter. The more you share, the more personal it gets, but we guide you through it. There's no wrong amount.</p>

          <h3>Can I edit the letter before it's printed?</h3>
          <p>Yes. You see a full design proof before anything goes to print. Edit any line, regenerate the letter, or start over. Nothing prints until you say it's right. 100% satisfaction guarantee.</p>
