          <h3>How does a Letter From Heaven for loss of a wife work?</h3>
          <p>You share memories about your wife &ndash; her personality, things she said, the way she made people feel, a favorite memory. We write a first-person letter from her perspective, as if she's speaking directly to you and the family she loved. You approve every word before we print.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Will the letter actually sound like her?</h3>
          <p>We ask about her personality, how she spoke, and the things she used to say. A wife who left sticky notes on the mirror sounds different from one who showed love by staying up late helping with homework. The more you share, the more it sounds like her.</p>

        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Can I send this as a sympathy gift to a widower?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Many of our orders are sympathy gifts from close friends and family. The letter is warm and comforting &ndash; it celebrates who she was and the love she showed every day, not how she died. Families tell us it becomes the most meaningful thing in the house.</p>

          <h3>What if I don't have many details to share?</h3>
          <p>Even a name, a photo, and one or two memories make a beautiful letter. The more you share, the more personal it gets, but we guide you through it. There's no wrong amount.</p>

          <h3>Can I edit the letter before it's printed?</h3>
          <p>Yes. You see a full design proof before anything goes to print. Edit any line, regenerate the letter, or start over. Nothing prints until you say it's right. 100% satisfaction guarantee.</p>
