          <h3>How does a Letter From Heaven for loss of a child work?</h3>
          <p>You share memories about your child &ndash; their personality, things they said or did, how they made people feel. We write a first-person letter from their perspective, as if they're speaking to the parents and family who loved them. You approve every word before we print.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Is this appropriate? I don't want something that feels forced.</h3>
          <p>We understand. This is not a generic sympathy card with a poem someone wrote for no one in particular. It's built entirely from what you share with us &ndash; real memories, real details, real love. The letter doesn't try to explain the loss or offer false comfort. It simply gives voice to the love your child felt. You read and approve every word before anything is printed.</p>

          <h3>Can I order this for a couple who lost their child?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Many orders come from grandparents, aunts, uncles, and close friends. You share whatever you know about the child &ndash; even a name, a photo, and a few details create something meaningful. If you're unsure what to write, email us at hello@stillbesideme.com and we'll help.</p>

          <h3>What if I can't get through the form without breaking down?</h3>
          <p>Then step away. There is no timer. You can save your progress and come back in an hour, a day, or a week. Many people fill it out over several sittings. If you'd rather tell us over email or phone, we can do that too. We'll meet you wherever you are.</p>

        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Can I edit the letter before it's printed?</h3>
          <p>Yes. You see a full design proof before anything goes to print. Edit any line, regenerate the letter, or start over. Nothing prints until you say it's right. 100% satisfaction guarantee.</p>
