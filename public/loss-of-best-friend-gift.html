      <h2>Questions about loss of best friend gifts</h2>
      <div class="faq-grid">
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>How does a Letter From Heaven for loss of a best friend work?</h3>
          <p>You share memories about your best friend &ndash; their personality, things they said, how they made people feel. We write a first-person letter from their perspective, as if they're speaking directly to you. You approve every word before we print.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Is this appropriate for a friend, not a family member?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely. Friendship is its own kind of family. The grief of losing a best friend is real and deep, and it often goes unacknowledged by the rest of the world. This tribute honors the relationship as it deserves &ndash; fully and without qualification. You don't need to be related by blood for this to matter.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Can I send this to my friend's family?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Many people order a Letter From Heaven for the family of a friend who passed. You share your memories, and we write the letter from their loved one's perspective. It shows the family that this person mattered to people beyond the household &ndash; and it means more than you might expect.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>What if I don't have many details to share?</h3>
          <p>Even a name, a photo, and one or two memories make a beautiful letter. The more you share, the more personal it gets, but we guide you through it. There's no wrong amount.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Can I edit the letter before it's printed?</h3>
          <p>Yes. You see a full design proof before anything goes to print. Edit any line, regenerate the letter, or start over. Nothing prints until you say it's right. 100% satisfaction guarantee.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Do you have memorial gifts for other relationships?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Letter From Heaven works for any relationship. Visit our <a href="/memorial-gifts">Memorial Gifts</a> page for all options.</p>
