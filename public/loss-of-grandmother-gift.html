          <h3>The wisdom she carried</h3>
          <p>She'd lived long enough to know what mattered and what didn't. The letter speaks from that place &ndash; the steady perspective of a woman who raised a family, weathered hard seasons, and came out the other side with grace. The kind of knowing you only get with time.</p>

          <h3>The traditions she'd want you to keep alive</h3>
          <p>Her recipe for Sunday dinner. The way she decorated for the holidays. The stories she told about people you never met but feel like you knew. The letter holds these details close &ndash; not as nostalgia, but as a quiet request to carry them forward.</p>

          <h3>The love that skipped nothing</h3>
          <p>A grandmother's love is different. It comes without the daily discipline, without the arguments about homework. It's pure adoration, and she gave it freely. The letter speaks from that unconditional place &ndash; the kind of love that sees no faults.</p>

      <h2>Questions about loss of grandmother gifts</h2>
      <div class="faq-grid">
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>How does a Letter From Heaven for loss of a grandmother work?</h3>
          <p>You share memories about your grandmother &ndash; her personality, things she said, her traditions, the way she made you feel. We write a first-person letter from her perspective, as if she's speaking to the grandchildren and family she adored. You approve every word before we print.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Will the letter actually sound like my grandmother?</h3>
          <p>We ask about her personality, how she spoke, and the things she used to say. A grandmother who always had cookies in the oven sounds different from one who told the same three stories every visit because she loved telling them. The more you share, the more it sounds like her.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Is this a good Mother's Day memorial gift?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Many grandchildren order this around Mother's Day to honor a grandmother who filled a motherly role in their lives. It's also a meaningful gift for a parent who lost their own mother &ndash; a way to hear her voice again on a day that can feel impossibly heavy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Is this appropriate for grandchildren to order?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely. Many of our orders come from adult grandchildren honoring a grandmother who shaped their lives. You can also order it on behalf of a parent who just lost their mother &ndash; it makes a deeply personal sympathy gift that says more than flowers ever could.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Can I edit the letter before it's printed?</h3>
          <p>Yes. You see a full design proof before anything goes to print. Edit any line, regenerate the letter, or start over. Nothing prints until you say it's right. 100% satisfaction guarantee.</p>

        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
