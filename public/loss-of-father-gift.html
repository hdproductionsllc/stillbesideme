          <h3>How does a Letter From Heaven for loss of a father work?</h3>
          <p>You share memories about your father &ndash; his personality, things he said, how he showed up for the family. We write a first-person letter from his perspective, as if he's speaking to the people he loves. You approve every word before we print.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Will the letter sound like my dad?</h3>
          <p>We ask about his personality, how he spoke, and things he used to say. A father who called everyone "kiddo" sounds different from one who showed love by fixing things around the house. The more you share, the more it sounds like him.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Can I send this to someone who just lost their father?</h3>
          <p>Yes. The letter is warm and comforting &ndash; it celebrates who he was, not how he died. It focuses on pride, love, and the lessons he passed on. Families tell us it becomes the most meaningful thing in the house.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>What if my dad wasn't a big talker?</h3>
          <p>Many fathers show love through actions, not words. We understand that. A few details about how he showed up &ndash; fixing things, driving you to practice, quietly being there &ndash; are enough. The letter captures who he was, even if he wasn't one for long speeches.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Can I edit the letter before it's printed?</h3>
          <p>Yes. You see a full design proof before anything goes to print. Edit any line, regenerate the letter, or start over. Nothing prints until you say it's right. 100% satisfaction guarantee.</p>
