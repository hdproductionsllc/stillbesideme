          <h3>Does the poem mention things specific to my cat?</h3>
          <p>Yes. If your cat knocked things off the counter, claimed a particular sunbeam, or had a specific way of demanding attention, those details go into the poem. People read it and say "that's exactly them."</p>

          <h3>What if my cat was hard to photograph?</h3>
          <p>We understand &ndash; cats aren't always cooperative subjects. We color-correct, upscale, and optimize every image for print. Even a slightly blurry phone photo comes out looking beautiful in the finished frame.</p>

        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Can I send this to someone who just lost their cat?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely. People often underestimate how much someone grieves a cat. This gift shows you understand. Even just a name and photo make a beautiful tribute, and we can ship directly to the recipient.</p>

          <h3>Can I edit the poem before it's printed?</h3>
          <p>Yes. You see a full preview with the photo, poem, and frame style before anything goes to print. Edit any line, regenerate the poem, or choose from our curated library. You have complete control.</p>
