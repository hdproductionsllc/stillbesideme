          <p>Show up. Keep your word. Take care of your people. He didn't lecture about integrity &ndash; he just lived it, every day, until it became the standard. The letter speaks from that bedrock, reminding you of the things he stood for without ever having to say them.</p>

          <h3>How does a Letter From Heaven for loss of a grandfather work?</h3>
          <p>You share memories about your grandfather &ndash; his personality, things he said, his stories, the way he showed love. We write a first-person letter from his perspective, as if he's speaking to the grandchildren and family he was proud of. You approve every word before we print.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Will the letter actually sound like my grandfather?</h3>
          <p>We ask about his personality, how he spoke, and the things he used to say. A grandfather who taught you to fish sounds different from one who sat quietly in his armchair and let you climb all over him. The more you share, the more it sounds like him.</p>

          <h3>Is this a good Father's Day memorial gift?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Many grandchildren order this around Father's Day to honor a grandfather who filled a fatherly role in their lives. It's also a meaningful gift for a parent who lost their own father &ndash; a way to hear his voice again on a day that can feel impossibly heavy.</p>

        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Is this appropriate for grandchildren to order?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely. Many of our orders come from adult grandchildren honoring a grandfather who shaped their character. You can also order it on behalf of a parent who just lost their father &ndash; it makes a deeply personal sympathy gift that says more than flowers ever could.</p>

          <h3>Can I edit the letter before it's printed?</h3>
          <p>Yes. You see a full design proof before anything goes to print. Edit any line, regenerate the letter, or start over. Nothing prints until you say it's right. 100% satisfaction guarantee.</p>
