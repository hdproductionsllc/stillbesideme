          <h3>The future he'd want for you</h3>
          <p>He wouldn't want you to stop living. The letter speaks to the life ahead &ndash; the permission to laugh again, the reassurance that choosing happiness isn't forgetting him. It's the conversation he'd want to have if he could sit beside you one more time.</p>

          <h3>How does a Letter From Heaven for loss of a husband work?</h3>
          <p>You share memories about your husband &ndash; his personality, things he said, how he made you feel, the way he showed love. We write a first-person letter from his perspective, as if he's speaking directly to you and the family he built with you. You approve every word before we print.</p>

        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Will the letter actually sound like him?</h3>
          <p>We ask about his personality, how he spoke, and the things he used to say. A husband who left little love notes sounds different from one who showed love by mowing the lawn at 7 a.m. or driving three hours to fix something at your parents' house. The more you share, the more it sounds like him.</p>

          <h3>Can I send this as a sympathy gift to a widow?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Many of our orders are sympathy gifts from close friends and family. The letter is warm and comforting &ndash; it celebrates the love he carried and the life he built, not how he died. Widows tell us it becomes the most treasured thing in the house.</p>

          <h3>What if I don't have many details to share?</h3>
          <p>Even a name, a photo, and one or two memories make a beautiful letter. The more you share, the more personal it gets, but we guide you through it. There's no wrong amount.</p>

          <h3>Can I edit the letter before it's printed?</h3>
          <p>Yes. You see a full design proof before anything goes to print. Edit any line, regenerate the letter, or start over. Nothing prints until you say it's right. 100% satisfaction guarantee.</p>
