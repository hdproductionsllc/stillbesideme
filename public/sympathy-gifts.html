          <h3>I don't know all the details. Can I still order?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely. Even just a name and a photo make a beautiful tribute. The more you share, the more personal it gets, but we guide you through it either way. Many of our best orders come from friends who only knew the basics.</p>

          <h3>Can you ship directly to the person I'm sending it to?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Enter the recipient's address at checkout and we'll ship it straight to their door. It arrives beautifully packaged and ready to hang &ndash; no additional wrapping needed.</p>

          <h3>I need it to arrive quickly. Is that possible?</h3>
          <p>Most orders ship within 5&ndash;7 business days. Rush options are available at checkout for faster delivery. Every frame is carefully packaged to arrive in perfect condition.</p>

          <h3>Is this appropriate for someone who lost a person, not a pet?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Our Letter From Heaven collection is designed specifically for human memorials &ndash; loss of a mother, father, spouse, grandparent, or sibling. It's a personalized letter written from the perspective of the person who passed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Do I get to see the tribute before it ships?</h3>
          <p>Yes. You see a full design proof before we print anything. You can edit every word, regenerate the poem, or choose from our curated library. Nothing ships until you approve the final design.</p>

          <h3>What makes this better than flowers or a card?</h3>
          <p>Flowers die in a week. Cards end up in a drawer. This is a personalized tribute written from real memories, printed alongside their photo in a handcrafted frame &ndash; it goes on the wall and stays there for years.</p>
