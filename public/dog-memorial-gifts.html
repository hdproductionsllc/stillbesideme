        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>What makes this different from other dog memorial gifts?</h3>
          <p>Most dog memorials stamp a name on a stone or ornament. Ours is a personalized poem written from the specific memories you share &ndash; their quirks, their personality, the things only your family would know. Printed alongside their photo in a handcrafted frame.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Does the poem actually mention things specific to my dog?</h3>
          <p>Yes. The poem is built from the details you share. If your dog stole socks, greeted everyone at the door, or had a special spot on the couch, those details go into the poem. It reads like someone who knew them wrote it.</p>

          <h3>What if I only have a phone photo?</h3>
          <p>That works perfectly. We color-correct, upscale, and optimize every image for print. Even a casual phone photo of your dog comes out sharp and beautiful in the finished frame.</p>

          <h3>Can I send this as a gift to someone who just lost their dog?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely. Many of our orders are sympathy gifts. Even just a name and photo make a beautiful tribute. We guide you through it and can ship directly to the recipient.</p>
