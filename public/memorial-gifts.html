          <h3>Is this appropriate? It sounds intense.</h3>
          <p>The letter is warm, comforting, and celebrates who they were &ndash; not how they died. It focuses on presence, love, and the life they lived. Families tell us it feels like hearing from them one more time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Does this work for any relationship?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Mother, father, spouse, grandparent, sibling, child, close friend &ndash; the letter is written from their perspective, tailored to the relationship and the memories you share.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Will the letter actually sound like them?</h3>
          <p>We ask about their personality, how they spoke, and things they used to say. A grandmother who said "bless your heart" sounds different from a father who called everyone "kiddo." The more details you share, the more it sounds like them.</p>

          <h3>What if I'm not happy with the letter?</h3>
          <p>You see a full design proof before we print. Edit every word, regenerate the letter, or start over. If the finished piece doesn't meet your expectations, we'll make it right. 100% satisfaction guarantee.</p>

          <h3>Can I order this as a gift for someone else?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Many of our orders are gifts for someone who's grieving. Share what you know &ndash; even just a name and photo &ndash; and we'll create something meaningful. We can ship it directly to the recipient.</p>
