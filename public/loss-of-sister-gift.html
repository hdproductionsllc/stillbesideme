          <p>The shorthand nobody else understands. The look across the room that said everything. The way she could read your mood before you said a word.

          <h3>How does a Letter From Heaven for loss of a sister work?</h3>
          <p>You share memories about your sister &ndash; her personality, things she said, how she made people feel. We write a first-person letter from her perspective, as if she's speaking to her siblings and the family she loves. You approve every word before we print.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Will the letter actually sound like my sister?</h3>
          <p>We ask about her personality, how she talked, and the things she used to say. A sister who was the loud, funny one sounds different from one who showed love through listening and showing up. The more you share, the more it sounds like her. And you can edit every word before we print.</p>

        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Can I send this to someone who just lost their sister?</h3>
          <p>Yes. The letter is warm and personal &ndash; it celebrates who she was, not how she died. It focuses on the sister bond, the shared memories, and the things she'd want her family to know. Families tell us it becomes the most meaningful thing in the house.</p>

        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>What if I don't have many details to share?</h3>
          <p>Even a name, a photo, and one or two memories make a beautiful letter. The more you share, the more personal it gets, but we guide you through it. There's no wrong amount.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Can I edit the letter before it's printed?</h3>
          <p>Yes. You see a full design proof before anything goes to print. Edit any line, regenerate the letter, or start over. Nothing prints until you say it's right. 100% satisfaction guarantee.</p>
