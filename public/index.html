          <p>When I lost Littles &ndash; my Siamese, my shadow, the one who followed me from room to room and yelled at me until I picked him up &ndash; people sent flowers. They sent cards. Every single one was gone within a week. Not because they didn't care, but because there was nothing to keep.</p>
          <p>I wanted something that captured who he actually was. Not just his face, but the weird little voice he made when he wanted dinner. The way he'd curl up on my chest every single night. The nickname only we used. The specific, irreplaceable things that made him ours.</p>
          <p>I couldn't find it anywhere. So I built it.</p>
          <p>Every tribute we make starts with details only someone who loved them would know. The poem is written from those details. Then we print it alongside their photo in a frame that belongs on a wall for the rest of someone's life.</p>
          <p>We started with pets. Then families asked us to do the same for the people they'd lost. So we built Letter From Heaven &ndash; the same care, the same craft, for the humans who shaped our lives.</p>

          <h3>Can I edit the poem or letter?</h3>
          <p>Yes. You see a full preview before we print anything. You can edit every word, regenerate it, or choose from our curated library instead. You're in complete control.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>What if I'm not happy with the result?</h3>
          <p>You see a full design proof before we print. If the finished piece doesn't meet your expectations, we'll make it right. 100% satisfaction guarantee, no fine print.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>How long does shipping take?</h3>
          <p>Most orders ship within 5&ndash;7 business days. We carefully package every frame to arrive in perfect condition. Rush options available at checkout.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>I'm ordering as a gift and don't know all the details.</h3>
          <p>That's completely fine. Even just a name and photo make a beautiful tribute. The more you share, the more personal it gets &ndash; but we'll guide you through it either way.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>What if I don't have a great photo?</h3>

        </div>
        <div class="faq-item fade-in">
          <h3>Is this appropriate for a human memorial?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Our Letter From Heaven collection is specifically designed for human memorials. It's a personalized first-person letter written from the perspective of the person who passed &ndash; warm, comforting, and deeply personal.</p>
